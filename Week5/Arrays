Remove Members
Create a constructor which will add the deployer address as the first member of the stack club.
Create a removeLastMember function which will remove the last member added to the club.
 Function Security
Ensure that the removeLastMember function can only be called by an existing member

contract StackClub {
    address[] public members;

    constructor() {
        members.push(msg.sender);
    }
    modifier onlyMember() {
        require(isMember(msg.sender), "not a member");
        _;
    }

    function addMember(address newMember) external {
        members.push(newMember);
    }
    function removeLastMember() external onlyMember {
        require(members.length > 0, "no members to remove");
        members.pop();
    }

    function isMember(address account) public view returns (bool) {
        for(uint i = 0; i < members.length; i++) {
            if (members[i] == account) {
             return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

}
```
