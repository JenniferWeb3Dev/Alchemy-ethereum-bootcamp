Prime Block Winner
You'll find the PrimeGame contract in the new file PrimeGame.sol. This file has already imported the Prime library for you.

In this contract, create a function called isWinner that determines if the current block number is prime.
If it is prime, return true. A winner! 
If not, return false.

contract PrimeGame {
    using Prime for uint;

    function isWinner() public view returns (bool) {
        return block.number.isPrime();
    }
}
```
