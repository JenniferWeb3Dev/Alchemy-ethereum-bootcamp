 Plunder 
Create an external function called plunder which will take an array of addresses as its only parameter. There will be an ERC20 Token deployed to each of these addresses in the array.
In the plunder function, transfer the entire balance of each of these tokens owned by the Chest address and send them to the msg.sender.

import "./IERC20.sol";

contract Chest {
    function plunder(address[] calldata erc20s) external {
        for(uint i = 0; i < erc20s.length; i++) {
            IERC20 token = IERC20(erc20s[i]);
            uint balance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
            token.transfer(msg.sender, balance);
        }
    }
}
```
