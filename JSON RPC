 Total Balance
The getTotalBalance method will receive an array of several addresses.

Take each address and find its ether balance
Add all of these balances together to find the total balance of all the addresses and return it.

```javascript
const provider = require('./provider');

async function getTotalBalance(addresses) {
    let totalBalance = BigInt(0);

    for (const address of addresses) {
        const response = await provider.send({
            jsonrpc: "2.0",
            id: 1,
            method: "eth_getBalance",
            params: [address, "latest"]
        });

        const balance = BigInt(response.result);
        totalBalance += balance;
    }

    return totalBalance.toString();
}

module.exports = getTotalBalance;
```
