Find the Addresses
The findEther function is passed an address which has sent ether to several addresses. The goal of this function is to find every address that has received ether and return it in an array of addresses.

```javascript
const { providers } = require('ethers');
const { ganacheProvider } = require('./config');

const provider = new providers.Web3Provider(ganacheProvider);

async function findEther(address) {
    const addresses = [];
    const blockNumber = await provider.getBlockNumber();
    for (let i = 0; i <= blockNumber; i++) {
        const block = await provider.getBlockWithTransactions(i);
        block.transactions.forEach((tx) => {
            if(tx.from === address) {
                addresses.push(tx.to);
            }
        });
    }
    return addresses;
}
```

module.exports = findEther;
